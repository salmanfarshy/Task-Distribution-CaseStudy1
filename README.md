## Task Distribution Application

### Steps of running the application

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salmanfarshy/Task-Distribution-CaseStudy1.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Task-Distribution-CaseStudy1
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   node Main_Node.js
   ```

5. Then, start a node:
   ```bash
   node Nodes/node1.js
   ```

Remember the number of nodes will be the number of types. So, based on your number of types you can create a new node into the Nodes directory. Like, `cd Nodes` then create a new one.
